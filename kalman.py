### Implementing discrete Kalman filter ###
""" Function for implementing a discrete Kalman filter
A Kalman filter uses a probability distribution to predict the next value from a source,
such as a sensor. It then updates this probability distribution based on the value given
from the source, providing a smoothing effect in a similar way to a moving average filter.
It works in two stages, first prediction, where it guesses what the next value from the sensor
will be, then correction, where it uses the actual value from the source to correct its prediction.
It requires 3 main parameters to be determined externally to use:
    A - The 'prediction matrix', which determines the predicted state of the system, this can
    usually be approximated as 1 for one-dimensional systems, or an identity matrix for higher order
    Q - The covariance of the 'process noise', this is static and represents the idea
    of how quickly the system responds to external input
    R - The covariance of the 'signal noise', this is static and is a measure of how
    much noise is expected in the system
The remaining 3 inputs are variable, and change as the filter is used:
    z - The input from the source, usually a sensor
    x_prev - The previous output from the filter -- Usually initialised as zero
    P_prev - The previous value of the 'confidence' matrix, or the value of the corrected error
    covariance -- This can be initialised at anything EXCEPT zero, and will correct itself as it's used,
    better initial estimates will result in faster convergence
NOTE: This is still being developed, and can still be vastly improved
