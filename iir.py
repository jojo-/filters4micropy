## Implementing discrete IIR ##
"""Functions for first and second order discrete IIR filtering
Coefficients for the numerator and denominator can be determined using various filter
design software, such as Matlab
It is possible to implement higher order filters by chaining multiple first and second order filters
together, the coefficients of these would again need to be calculated manually
The functions are intended to work on microprocessors using micropython, the example
shown below uses Python functions only to create an example dataset and plot the results

NOTE: The filters do introduce a significant time delay in the signal, which needs to be taken
into account when using them. An example of how to delay the output is shown, but is not the most
efficient way of doing this"""
